# A simple responsive news app

## Technologies used:

### React / Redux / Firebase / SCSS and a bunch of React/Redux components

Functionalities: 
User registration, sign in, logged in users can post new news articles and delete them
NOTE: The app is buggy and needs improvement. The main goal for me was to see how to get the various technologies I used to work together.
